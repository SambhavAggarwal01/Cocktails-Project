# Cocktails-Project
A Vanilla JavaScript Application for Display &amp; Searching a wide variety of Cocktails using The CocktailDB API

In this Project the JavaScript Fuctionality is divided into various "Modules" for code maintainability, reusability & reducing redudancy of code. Making use of Modules makes the code efficient to use and debugging the code is easier.

This Application uses the concept of AJAX to fetch the data from the API.

The Application initially automatically loads a Menu of Cocktails as soon as it is started. 

The user can search for a perticular cocktail(s) through a vast database of various cocktails provided by the API.

As soon as the user starts typing in the Search Bar of the application, the application starts providing the cocktail for the every individual letter the user types.

The user can click on a cocktail to view it in a seperate page having the information about the cocktail containing the image of the cocktail with some general information about the cocktail along with it's ingredients.

The user can easily switch back to the main menu by a button provided in the description page of a particular cocktail.

In case a cocktail is not found an error message is displayed and a loading image is shown and within a few seconds the user is automatically brought back to the main menu page.
